		<h2>Computer Science and Computer Literacy</h2>
		<p>Most schools offer computer classes, but not in the capacity that some students would like. The classes can be too elementary for students seeking education in advanced technology like programming, databases, or data analysis.</p>
		<p>A 2020 report from the Brookings Institution details the differences between computer science education and computer literacy courses.</p>

		<h2>The Facts About Computer Science Classes</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Less than half of high schools in America offer computer science of any form</li>
			<li>Students who take compuer science courses are more likely to enrol in college and possess improved problem-solving skills</li>
			<li>Taking computer science courses in middle school improve general confidence of students and increase interest in computer science careers.</li>

		<h2>Why is this important?</h2>
		<p>Technology industry jobs are quickly growing, and they have been for decades. However, the number of students going to school to learn computer science has not been enough to meet the increasing demand for workers with this training. One reason students are not studying this subject in high enough numbers is the lack of preparation they recieve prior to college.</p>
		<p>When students feel unprepared to study a subject, they are unlikely to pursue a degree in that field, and if they do, they might feel overwhelmed by all the information and experience burnout. Therefore, it is important for school systems to provide and encourage computer science education at a much younger age and much more commonly than it currently is.</p>
		<p>Even students who are not interested in a field in the technology industry can benefit from taking computer science classes - Students who enrol in these classes show improved skills in many outlets in their academic careers.</p>
		<p>Australia's approach to teaching computer science is something all countries should strive for: It is a requirement for young students to advance, and older students are given the opportunity to learn and demonstrate their skills in advanced technologies, all before college.</p>
